<b>Programming Assignment 6:</b><br>
<b>Linked List Utilities</b><br>
<b>Due Date: March 29, 11:59 pm</b><br>

<p>In class, we have been talking about ordered linked lists and unordered
   linked lists.  In this assignment, you will be blurring the line between
   those by writing helper methods for a generic LinkedList class that
   allows you to manipulate both kinds of linked lists.</p>

<ul>
   <li>You will want to reuse your definition of class Node.</li>
   <li>You will find it helpful to cannibalize from the definitions of
       the methods we defined for the classes unorderedList and
       orderedList.</li>
   <li><b>For this assignment, you should assume that all information
          stored in the "data" field of each node points to a string, NOT
          an integer.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The methods you must define for the class LinkedList include:</p>
<pre>

  def __str__ (self):
     # Return a string representation of data suitable for printing.
     #    Long lists (more than 10 elements long) should be neatly
     #    printed with 10 elements to a line, two spaces between
     #    elements
  
  def addFirst (self, item): 
     # Add an item to the beginning of the list

  def addLast (self, item): 
     # Add an item to the end of a list

  def addInOrder (self, item): 
     # Insert an item into the proper place of an ordered list.
     # This assumes that the original list is already properly
     #    ordered.

  def getLength (self):
     # Return the number of items in the list 
     
  def findUnordered (self, item): 
     # Search in an unordered list
     #    Return True if the item is in the list, False
     #    otherwise.

  def findOrdered (self, item): 
     # Search in an ordered list
     #    Return True if the item is in the list, False
     #    otherwise.
     # This method MUST take advantage of the fact that the
     #    list is ordered to return quicker if the item is not
     #    in the list.

  def delete (self, item):
     # Delete an item from an unordered list
     #    if found, return True; otherwise, return False

  def copyList (self):
     # Return a new linked list that's a copy of the original,
     #    made up of copies of the original elements

  def reverseList (self): 
     # Return a new linked list that contains the elements of the
     #    original list in the reverse order.

  def orderList (self): 
     # Return a new linked list that contains the elements of the
     #    original list arranged in ascending (alphabetical) order.
     #    Do NOT use a sort function:  do this by iteratively
     #    traversing the first list and then inserting copies of
     #    each item into the correct place in the new list.

  def isOrdered (self):
     # Return True if a list is ordered in ascending (alphabetical)
     #    order, or False otherwise

  def isEmpty (self): 
     # Return True if a list is empty, or False otherwise

  def mergeList (self, b): 
     # Return an ordered list whose elements consist of the 
     #    elements of two ordered lists combined.

  def isEqual (self, b):
     # Test if two lists are equal, item by item, and return True.

  def removeDuplicates (self):
     # Remove all duplicates from a list, returning a new list.
     #    Do not change the order of the remaining elements.
</pre>

<p><b>Main Program:</b></p>

<p>You do not need to write a main program for this assignment.  Instead,
   download the main program from here:</p>

<p><a href="LinkedListMain.py">Main Program for HW6</a></p>

<p>Attach the contents of this file to the class
   definitions and functions that you have written, and run the file.
   Correct any errors that occur in YOUR code.  <b>Do NOT change the main
   program!  It is written exactly the way we want it.</b></p>

<p><b>Input:</b></p>

<p>There is no data file for this program.</p>

<p><b>Output:</b></p>

<p>The output of your program will be generated by the main program, so
   you do not need to include any print statements in your code.  Be
   sure to carefully review the output you get to ensure your code is
   behaving correctly.</p>

<p><b>General requirements:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You must submit a file called LinkedLists.py via Canvas by the deadline
    shown at the top of this page.</li>
<li>As always, I will be looking for good documentation, descriptive variable
    names, clean logical structure, and adherence to all coding conventions
    expected of an experienced programmer; there will be penalties for failure
    to meet these standards.</li>
<li>Your code must compile and run before submission. </li>
<li>Don't forget to include the header (as described in previous assignments)! </li>
</ul>
